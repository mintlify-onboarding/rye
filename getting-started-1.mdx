## How Rye works

Rye allows developers to request products from different sources. These products will then be eligible for checkout via Rye.

### Use case

The Rye API allows you to build an end-to-end e-commerce experience. The API offers everything you need to build a full e-commerce offering, without having to worry about logistics, and/or owning inventory. Let your customers shop directly from Amazon and Shopify.

Developers can mix and match our APIs to create virtually any e-commerce experience. Developers can utilize the Product API to fetch product information and use that along with the Cart API to place an order for that product!
