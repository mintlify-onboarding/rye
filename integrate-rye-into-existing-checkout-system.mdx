title: "Integrate Rye into existing checkout system"
---

There are two scenarios to focus on based on what you want the user to be able to do.

#### Checkout only one item at once

* Start identifying which products come from Rye and which products already exist in your current database
* For products that come from Rye, adjust your checkout flow to ask for additional information that is required by Rye to perform a successful checkout.

#### Checkout multiple items at once

There are three cases to deal regarding items in cart:

  
* **Only Rye products in a cart:**  
   * Adjust your checkout flow to ask for additional information that is required by Rye to perform a successful checkout.
* **Only your products in a cart:**  
   * Continue with your existing flow.
* **Mix of Rye and your products in a cart:**  
   * Collect all information that is required by Rye.  
   * When customer shipping address is added, give user the ability to select a shipping method for Rye items.  
   * During the payment step, complete the payment for Rye items via Rye Pay or `submitCart` and use the same payment token / spreedly token to complete the payment for items from your database.
