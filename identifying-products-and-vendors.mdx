### Example workflows for identifying products:

  
#### 1\. You already have a list of products/stores in mind

Check if the products/stores you have are supported by Rye. Rye currently supports: Shopify global and Amazon US products.  
  
#### 2\. You are looking for inspiration for products

When you sign up with Rye, we provide a CSV of the top 10,000 shopify stores in the [Developer Resources](https://console.rye.com/resources) section, the list also contains some additional information that can guide your product selection workflow including category information.
