<Steps>
  <Step title="Grab your API Key">
    To make requests to the Rye GraphQL API, you will need to get an API access key by signing up on the Rye console. To do so:

    1. Navigate, and log in to [https://console.rye.com](https://console.rye.com/account)
    2. Under Access and Security, view and copy your API key

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize GQL client">

Initialize a GQL client with your API key via the following recipe:

```javascript
import { GraphQLClient, gql } from 'graphql-request'

const endpoint = 'https://graphql.api.rye.com/v1/query'
const client = new GraphQLClient(endpoint)
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Basic <API Key Here>',
  'rye-shopper-ip': 'xxx.xxx.x.x'
}

```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Making your first GraphQL request">
    Rye uses GraphQL as the underlying technology to expose its API to developers. Read more about GraphQL [here](https://graphql.org/).

    Here is an example of fetching an Amazon product from GraphQL. Make sure to replace your API key in the examples below.

<CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Shopify
    async function fetchProduct() {
  const variables = {
    "input": {
      "id": "7074033139917",
      "marketplace": "SHOPIFY"
    }
  };    
    ```

    ```javascript Amazon
    function fetchProduct() {
  const variables = {
    "input": {
      "id": "B09H6T8LTR",
      "marketplace": "AMAZON"
    }
  };
```
</CodeGroup>
  </Step>
<Step title="Explore the rest of the API">
Explore the entire API offering live on the [Rye Console](https://console.rye.com/). Take a glance through the remaining docs to figure out how the Rye API can integrate into your app!
