title: "submitCart"
description: "Submits an existing cart for checkout."

> ðŸš§
> 
> Normally the developers should not call this mutation directly because the cart submission is handled via the rye-pay script ([available here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rye-api/rye-pay)). The mutation can be used only if developers are going to manage to receive the Spreedly payment method token by themselves. 
> 
> Find more information about the rye-pay script [here](/docs/rye-pay).

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> If the cart contains products from different stores then multiple orders will be created - one order per each store.

---

> ðŸš§
> 
> Success response of this mutation does not guarantee that the order has been placed successfully. To track order status use [checkoutByCartId](/reference/orderbyid) or [orderById](/reference/orderbyid-new) mutations

---

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> If the cart has been successfully submitted, an attempt to submit the cart again will lead to an error.
> 
> If the cart has multiple stores it is possible that checkout succeeds only for some of them. In this case, the cart can be submitted again. It has no effect on already submitted stores in the cart.
