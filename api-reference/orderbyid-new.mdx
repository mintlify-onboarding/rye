title: "orderById"
description: "Returns an Order object by ID. This query can be used to retrieve information about the individual order."
---

<Note>
    When called for a not submitted cart, [Order.status](/api-reference/orderstatus) will always be `PENDING` and [Order.events](/api-reference/orderevent) array will be empty. After cart submission [Order.status](/api-reference/orderstatus) will change according to the current checkout state and the [Order.events](/api-reference/orderevent) array will be populated.
</Note>

Sometimes, when using the orderById query, the returned status may be `ACTION_REQUIRED`. In this case, you should check the "requiredActions" field for each order with this status and perform the necessary actions. Currently, there is only one required action: `CompletePaymentChallenge`, also known as 3D-S Challenge.

3D-S (3D-Secure) is a security protocol designed to provide an additional layer of authentication for online credit and debit card transactions. When a customer attempts to make a payment, they are redirected to their bank's website, where they are asked to enter a unique password to confirm their identity. This helps prevent fraud and unauthorized purchases.

If 3D-S challenge completion is required, you should display the `redirectURL` to the end buyer. Once the end buyer completes the challenge, Rye will continue with order processing.
