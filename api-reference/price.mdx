---

`currency`: [Currency!](/reference/currency)

A Currency value indicating the currency in which the price is denominated. This is typically represented by a standardized three-letter currency code, such as USD for United States Dollars or EUR for Euros.

---

`displayValue`: `String!`

A formatted string that represents the price in a human-readable format, including the currency symbol and appropriate decimal places. For example, if the price is $10.99 in US Dollars, the displayValue will be "$10.99".
