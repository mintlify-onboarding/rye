The Products API lets you request data on any product from any Shopify or Amazon US store. 

The product data can be combined with the ability to place orders for those products via our [Cart API](/order), to build powerful and complete eCommerce experiences anywhere.

[You can find the full list of product data available here](/amazon-and-shopify-product-comparison).

Examples include: 

* Product title
* Product Images
* Product Descriptions
* Price etc.

To fetch product data for your app, you need to first select and add desired products to the Rye inventory. From there, you can sync products to your app.

## 1\. Add products to the Rye Inventory

You can add products to the Rye Inventory either by individual product links or whole stores in one go via the following queries:

| Add products by     | Info needed                                                                                                        | Example                                                                                                             | Query                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual products | Product page [URL](/api-reference/requestproductbyurlinput-1) and [marketplace](/api-reference/requestproductbyurlinput-1) | [https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-tree-runners](https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-tree-runners), SHOPIFY | [requestProductByURL](/api-reference/requestproductbyurl) |
| Whole stores        | Merchant store [URL](/api-reference/requestproductbyurlinput)                                                          | [https://www.allbirds.com](https://www.allbirds.com)                                                                | [requestStoreByURL](/api-reference/requeststorebyurl)     |

  
## 2\. Query product data from the Rye Inventory to your app

You can query product data of individual products (on all Shopify & Amazon stores) or all of the products of a single store (only supported for Shopify stores for now).

| Query product data by | Info needed                                                                             | Example                                     | Query                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual products   | Product [id](/api-reference/productbyidinput)and [marketplace](/api-reference/productbyidinput) | 6767362474059, SHOPIFY;B07H2V5YLH, AMAZON   | [productByID](/api-reference/productbyid)              |
