### eCommerce concepts

**Product**

* Refers to items listed on merchants' inventory. However, product variant must be specified to place an order, e.g. size and color of product. Each `product_variant` is associated with a unique id.

**Inventory**

* Product data and meta data supplied by merchants, including price, image, and stock availability. Rye has an up-to-date database that developers can pull from using the Products API.

**Cart**

* A cart contains one or more product\_variant. Rye supports carts with items from multiple merchants, hosted on multiple eCommerce building platforms. The whole cart is submitted when an order is placed

**Checkout**

* Payment processing for the items in cart. Rye supports a native checkout experience (no need to redirect to individual merchant sites) using most payment methods (see more on [Rye Pay](/docs/rye-pay)).

**Order**

* Rye programmatically sends orders to merchants and returns an `order_id`.

**GMV**

* Gross merchandise value, refers to the total value of goods exchanged on the platform. This excludes add-ons such as shipping and tax.

**Developer monetization**

* Developers have 2 ways to monetize with Rye: adding a % markup on MSRP or getting a % commission of the GMV of each sale.

**Commission rate**

* % of the GMV as a reward for the platform that facilitated the sale. Developers can specify a set commission rate with merchants they have an existing relationship with. Merchants that integrate directly with Rye are able to set a custom commission rate. Developers are likely to prioritise products with higher commission rates.

**Shipping details**

* A valid shipping method and shipping address must be submitted for an order to be successfully placed and fulfilled. Shipping options are defined by merchants, which sometimes use third-party logistics (3PL) providers.

**Tools**

* B2B services (mostly commonly in the form of Shopify apps) that facilitate the eCommerce experience, e.g. loyalty and reward programmes, order tracking, bundles and upsell. Rye has a Shopify app for merchants to plug into.

**Webhooks**

* A method to notify one system about updates in an external system. Rye has webhooks that send real-time updates such as order placed, order failed, and tracking info.
