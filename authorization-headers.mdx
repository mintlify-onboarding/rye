### Authorization

The authorization header is required for developers to be able to access all queries/mutations of the Rye API. The header can be obtained from the [Rye console](https://console.rye.com/account), Under Account â†’ Access and Security, view and copy your API key.

The header is of the following format:

```JSON JSON
{
  "Authorization": "Basic << API Key here >>",
  "rye-shopper-ip": "<< Your IP address her e>>"
}
```

### rye-shopper-ip (Optional)

This header is required for making requests on behalf of the end user because some systems such as Shopify have fraud risk calculations based on the end user IP (ex: if the IP matches the billing address IP).

```JSON JSON
{
	"rye-shopper-ip": "103.123.5.23"
}
```

<Warning>
  rye-shopper-ip header is required to use the [submitCart ](/api-reference/submitcart)mutation.
</Warning>

### Where to find these headers

These headers can be found if you head to [https://console.rye.com/graphql](https://console.rye.com/graphql) and click on the HTTP Headers tab at the bottom of the screen.
