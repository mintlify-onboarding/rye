Another way to monetize your experiences with Rye is to markup products. Rye currently allows the ability to mark up products based on a percentage or a dollar amount per item. Access this feature in the Rye console on the [Accounts page](https://console.rye.com/account)

The margin can be set as a % of each item or a dollar amount per item. The margin will be paid out monthly directly to the developer.
